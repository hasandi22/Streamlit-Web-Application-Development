Heart Disease Prediction App
An interactive Streamlit web application for exploring, visualizing, and predicting heart disease using a trained machine learning model.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Data Exploration â€“ View dataset shape, data types, and sample records
Interactive Filtering â€“ Filter patients by age range
Data Visualization â€“ Histogram, correlation heatmap, and interactive scatter plots
Model Prediction â€“ Enter patient health attributes and get predictions with confidence scores
Model Performance â€“ Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and model comparisons

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset is the Heart Disease UCI dataset, containing patient health metrics such as:

Age
Sex
Chest pain type
Resting blood pressure
Cholesterol
Fasting blood sugar
Maximum heart rate achieved
Exercise-induced angina
And more...

Target variable: target (1 = heart disease present, 0 = absent)

ðŸ¤– Model

Algorithm: Best-performing ML model chosen after comparison (saved as best_model.joblib)
Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
Prediction Output: Disease presence with confidence percentage

ðŸš€ Deployment
The app has been deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.
